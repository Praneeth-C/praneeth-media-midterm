            The brown bear patient goes to the hospital to get heart surgery and is operated on by the surgeon frog. The surgery is completed successfully, 
            and the bear feels much better as a result. When the nurse (red bear) comes into the room and helps the patient become comfortable, she gives the
            bill for the surgery to the patient, who happily takes it, not noticing the hefty price he must pay. When the patient opens the bill, the happiness
            from his face drains away, and the patient is left sad, having to pay a significant amount of money to cover the cost of his necessary heart surgery,
            though he does not have enough money to cover the costs.

                I worked on all of the scenes in the film as we had to restart our project and reshoot the whole film. These 
            scenes involved the bear getting surgery by the frog cardiac surgeon, the bear receiving the medical bill from the 
            red bear nurse, and the bear opening the bill and feeling sad about its high medical debt.

                <pre> input.buttonA.onEvent(ButtonEvent.Click, function () {
    light.setAll(0xffffff)
    brightness_click += 20
    light.setBrightness(brightness_click)
})
input.buttonB.onEvent(ButtonEvent.Click, function () {
    light.setAll(0xffffff)
    brightness_click += -20
    light.setBrightness(brightness_click)

let brightness_click = 0

                I used the Dragonframe Software to shoot the frames for the film by using the onion-skin, live toggle, 
            and capture features on the camera board. I also used the Crickit hardware coded with the MakeCode Adafruit 
            software for the various lightings of the scenes, in which I covered the background with cardboard boxes and 
            held the Crickit over the scenes, changing the brightness of the light by pressing the buttons. The happy scenes 
            were bright, while the sad scenes were dark and gloomy. When button A on the Crickit is pressed, the brightness 
            of the light increases by a paramter of 20; when button B is pressed, the brightness of the light decreases by a
            parameter of 20. As a result, the brightness of the light can properly be increased and decreased gradually without
            missing any important stages in brightness.

            <h2> Social Impact </h2>
                The representation of a helpless bear who has recently undergone surgery and has to pay a significant, unaffordable 
            debt to the hospital relates to the difficulties minority groups and low-income people face regularly due to having no 
            health insurance to cover most of their debts. Despite receiving a life-saving heart treatment, the bear now has to 
            experience a life-threatening debt to repay the dues of the treatment. As a result of the issues with the American 
            healthcare system, roughly 30 million Americans have no health insurance and recieve inadequate treatment. This animation 
            serves to provide awareness to the issue of high healthcare debt and unfair treatment among low-income individuals and to 
            urge the movement for adequate medical treatment for all people regardless of their economic status.
