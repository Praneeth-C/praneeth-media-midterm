                I worked on all of the scenes in the film as we had to restart our project and reshoot the whole film. These 
            scenes involved the bear getting surgery by the frog cardiac surgeon, the bear receiving the medical bill from the 
            red bear nurse, and the bear opening the bill and feeling sad about its high medical debt.

                I used the Dragonframe Software to shoot the frames for the film by using the onion-skin, live toggle, 
            and capture features on the camera board. I also used the Cricut hardware coded with the MakeCode Adafruit 
            software for the various lightings of the scenes, in which I covered the background with cardboard boxes and 
            held the Circut over the scenes, changing the brightness of the light by pressing the buttons. The happy scenes 
            were bright, while the sad scenes were dark and gloomy.
