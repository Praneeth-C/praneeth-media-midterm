                I worked on all of the scenes in the film as we had to restart our project and reshoot the whole film. These 
            scenes involved the bear getting surgery by the frog cardiac surgeon, the bear receiving the medical bill from the 
            red bear nurse, and the bear opening the bill and feeling sad about its high medical debt.

                <img src="tbh_code.png" alt="Your Short Description of the Image" width="450">
                I used the Dragonframe Software to shoot the frames for the film by using the onion-skin, live toggle, 
            and capture features on the camera board. I also used the Cricut hardware coded with the MakeCode Adafruit 
            software for the various lightings of the scenes, in which I covered the background with cardboard boxes and 
            held the Circut over the scenes, changing the brightness of the light by pressing the buttons. The happy scenes 
            were bright, while the sad scenes were dark and gloomy.

            <h2> Social Impact </h2>
                The representation of a helpless bear who has recently undergone surgery and has to pay a significant, unaffordable 
            debt to the hospital relates to the difficulties minority groups and low-income people face regularly due to having no 
            health insurance to cover most of their debts. Despite receiving a life-saving heart treatment, the bear now has to 
            experience a life-threatening debt to repay the dues of the treatment. As a result of the issues with the American 
            healthcare system, roughly 30 million Americans have no health insurance and recieve inadequate treatment.
